# Image---Encryption---Decryption---XOR
A Python project that encrypts and decrypts images using XOR logic for data security.
# 🖼️ Image Encryption and Decryption using XOR

This project demonstrates how images can be securely encrypted and decrypted using the **XOR (Exclusive OR)** operation in Python. The goal is to protect visual data from unauthorized access using a simple yet effective cryptographic technique.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypts and decrypts images using XOR logic  
- Maintains the quality of the original image after decryption  
- Uses **OpenCV** for image processing  
- Demonstrates basic cryptography concepts in an easy-to-understand way  
- Fast and lightweight implementation  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program reads the image file using **OpenCV**.  
2. Each pixel’s RGB value is XORed with a secret key.  
3. The result is an encrypted image that cannot be viewed normally.  
4. Running the same XOR operation again with the same key decrypts it back to the original image.
